## Welcome Card Banner

For the welcome card to display properly, please add an image file named `welcome-banner.jpg` in the public directory. This should be a banner image (recommended size 1200x300px) that represents your anime website.

You can use any anime-themed image that matches the style of your website. The image will be shown at the top of the welcome card that appears when a user first visits the site.

Without this image, the welcome card will display a pink placeholder background.
